# CHAOS MODE

## The Premise
**CHAOS MODE** is a party game for many players, where they square off to complete microgames as rapidly as possible while outlasting each other. 

Completing games quickly will *'attack'* other players by applying *'trash'* to their timers: this means that those players will have less time to complete their next game! Keep completing games and moving forward to prevent too much *'trash'* from building up!

Being unable to complete a game before time runs out will give you a *'strike'*, and four *'strikes'* will eliminate you from the match! Be the last one standing to win!

## Contributing 
Additional microgames can be contributed to **CHAOS MODE** relatively easily! 

More info later!
